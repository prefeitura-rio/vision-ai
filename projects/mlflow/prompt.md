### Scenarios examples:

- Example 1: Dry Road with Clear Traffic
```json
{{
    "objects": [
        {{
            "object": "image_corrupted",
            "label_explanation": "Image is clear, no distortion or data loss.",
            "label": "false"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "image_description",
            "label_explanation": "Urban road in daylight with vehicles, clear weather.",
            "label": "null"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "rain",
            "label_explanation": "Road surface is dry, no signs of water.",
            "label": "false"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "water_level",
            "label_explanation": "No water present, road surface completely dry.",
            "label": "low"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "road_blockade",
            "label_explanation": "Road is completely free of obstructions.",
            "label": "free"
        }}
    ]
}}
```

- Example 2: Partially Flooded Road with Moderate Obstructions
```json
{{
    "objects": [
        {{
            "object": "image_corrupted",
            "label_explanation": "Slight blurriness in the image, but generally clear.",
            "label": "true"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "image_description",
            "label_explanation": "Moderate traffic on an urban road with visible puddles.",
            "label": "null"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "rain",
            "label_explanation": "Puddles observed on parts of the road.",
            "label": "true"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "water_level",
            "label_explanation": "Water covers some parts of the road, forming puddles.",
            "label": "medium"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "road_blockade",
            "label_explanation": "Partial obstructions due to water, but traffic can pass.",
            "label": "partially"
        }}
    ]
}}
```

- Example 3: Fully Flooded and Blocked Road
```json
{{
    "objects": [
        {{
            "object": "image_corrupted",
            "label_explanation": "High quality, clear image with no issues.",
            "label": "false"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "image_description",
            "label_explanation": "Road completely submerged in water, no traffic visible.",
            "label": "null"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "rain",
            "label_explanation": "Road is fully covered in water.",
            "label": "true"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "water_level",
            "label_explanation": "Water level high, road completely submerged.",
            "label": "high"
        }},
        {{
            "object": "road_blockade",
            "label_explanation": "Road is entirely blocked by flooding, impassable.",
            "label": "totally"
        }}
    ]
}}
```


### Output

**Output Order**

- **Sequence**: Follow this order in your analysis:
    1. image_corrupted: true or false
    2. image_description: allways null
    3. rain: true or false
    4. water_level: low, medium or high
    5. road_blockade: free, partially or totally

- **Importance**: Adhering to this sequence ensures logical and coherent analysis, with each step informing the subsequent ones.



**Example Format**

- Present findings in a structured JSON format, following the provided example.

```json
{output_example}
```

- **Requirement**: Each label_explanation should be a 500-word interpretation of the image, demonstrating a deep understanding of the visible elements.
- **Important:** Think step by step
